    Construct a Hero object and then create a list that contains one of each of the
    dragons (FireDragon, FlyingDragon, FlyingFireDragon,). Present a menu that allows the user to
    choose which dragon to attack, and then another menu that gives them the option of attacking
    with a sword or an arrow. Call the heroâ€™s attack method on the dragon they chose and display
    the attack message returned. If the user defeats the dragon (hp is 0), then remove that dragon
    from the list. Then choose a random (surviving) dragon that will attack the user, and randomly
    choose either a basic or special attack and display the attack message returned. Repeat the
    attacks until the user defeats all three dragons, or until the hero is knocked out. Check all input
    for validity.
